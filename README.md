# Cifar10-Image-Recognition
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, and animals. The model is trained to identify the object category depicted in each image.
